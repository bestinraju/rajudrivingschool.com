This is a good idea where the car will be used for a Driver\u2019s Test. It is also a good idea when a learner has a new car and wishes to familiarise themselves with it prior to licensing. Safe Drive Driving School is able to offer customers training in their vehicle, provided the vehicle is registered, roadworthy and comprehensively insured.\n\nPrior to any training being conducted in the customer\u2019s vehicle, the instructor should inspect the vehicle for its roadworthiness. The inspection should include, but is not limited to, a check of the following items;\n<ul class=\"list-disc\">\n \t<li>the registration label is valid, current, intact and displayed appropriately<\/li>\n \t<li>the vehicle is comprehensively insured and the customer\u2019s insurance company is notified that it will be used by a driving instructor to conduct training in<\/li>\n \t<li>The tyres: \n<ul>\n \t<li>are correctly inflated (air pressures must reflect the manufacturer\u2019s recommendation as a minimum). <\/li>\n \t<li>have appropriate levels of tread <\/li>\n \t<li>are not damaged <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n \t<li>all indicators, headlights and brake lights are working <\/li>\n \t<li>seats and seat belts are in good working order and are not damaged or twisted <\/li>\n \t<li>any loose items in the cabin of the vehicle are stowed in the cargo (boot) area <\/li>\n \t<li>the windows and interior are clean <\/li>\n \t<li>the vehicle has sufficient petrol to last the course of the lesson (minimum requirement \u2013 a quarter of a tank) <\/li>\n<\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"item no\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tt-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAre automatic cars easier to drive?\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"tt-content\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you are ready, your Safe Drive Instructor will arrange your test for you on payment of the Transport Booking Fee.

Practice is essential and the more practice you have, the less number of professional driving lessons you may require to be at the standard required to pass the test. Practice is vital and the requirement is that a new driver has 100 hours of log book experience prior to sitting for their practical driving test.\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<!-- \/tt-accordion-box -->\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<!-- New Design -->\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Frequently Asked Questions Here you will find a list of complete and very practical answers.
